<h1 class="Shota" >Shota Rustaveli</h1>
<i><p class="description">Little, if anything, is known about Rustaveli from contemporary sources. Shota Rustaveli was born in 1166. He started serving Queen
     Tamar as a Minister of Finance in 1191. His poem itself, namely the prologue, provides a clue to his identity: the poet identifies himself as "a certain Rustveli." "Rustveli"
      is not a surname, but a territorial epithet that can be interpreted as "of/from/holder of Rustavi"; although a 10th century manuscript fragment found in 1975 in Saint Catherine
      's Monastery in Sinai attests to its use as a cognomen by a noble house of Ru(i)staveli.[2] Later Georgian authors from the 15th through 18th centuries are more informative; they are almost unanimous in identifying him as Shota Rustaveli
      , a name that is preserved on 
      a fresco and a document from the formerly Georgian Monastery of the Holy Cross at Jerusalem. The fresco was
       described by the Georgian pilgrim Timote Gabashvili in 1757/58 and rediscovered by a team of Georgian scholars in 1960. The same Jerusalem document speaks of Shota 
       as a sponsor of the monastery and a mechurchletukhutsesi ("high treasurer"),
        echoing a popular legend that Rustaveli was a minister at Queen Tamar’s
     court and retired to the monastery at an advanced age.</p></i>
